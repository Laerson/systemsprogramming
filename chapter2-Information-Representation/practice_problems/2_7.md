# Practice Problem 2.7

What would be printed as a result of the following call to `show_bytes`?

```c
const char *s = "abcdef";
show_bytes((byte_pointer) s, strlen(s));
```

Note that letters 'a' through 'z' have ASCII codes 0x61 through 0x7A.

## Solution

The strings s has the following hexadecimal representation:

```plaintext
0x61 0x62 0x63 0x64 0x65 0x66 0x00
```

strlen(s) returns the length of the string (not counting the null character), which is 6. So, the call to `show_bytes` will print only the first 6 bytes of the string, which are `0x61 0x62 0x63 0x64 0x65 0x66`.

so the output will be:

```plaintext
61 62 63 64 65 66
```

It is important to note that the endianness of the system does not affect the output in this case, because each character has only one byte, and the function prints the bytes in the order they are stored in memory.

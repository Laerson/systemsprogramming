# Practice Problem 2.2

Fill in the blank entries in the following table:

| n | 2^n (decimal) | 2^n (hexadecimal) |
|---|---------------|------------------|
| 5 | 32            | 0x20             |
| 23|              |                  |
|   | 32768         |                  |
|   |               | 0x2000           |
| 12|               |                  |
|   | 64            |                  |
|   |               | 0x100            |

## Solution

### Line 2

First we calculate the value of 2^23 in hexadecimal:

```plaintext
We know that 2^23 in binary is 1 followed by 23 zeros.
We need to know how many 0s are left when we group them in groups of 4 (the remainder of 23/4).
23/4 = 5 with a remainder of 3.
Therefore 2^23 in binary is 1000 followed by 5 groups of 4 zeros: 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000

Now we convert it to hexadecimal:
1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 = 0x800000
```

Then we can find the decimal value of 2^23 by either calculating it or converting the hexadecimal value to decimal.

2^23 = 8388608

### Line 3

We first convert 32768 to hexadecimal:

```plaintext
32768 / 16 = 2048 with a remainder of 0
2048 / 16 = 128 with a remainder of 0
128 / 16 = 8 with a remainder of 0
8 / 16 = 0 with a remainder of 8

Therefore 32768 in hexadecimal is 0x8000
```

Now we know that 32768 = 0x8000 = 1000 0000 0000 0000 (1 followed by 15 0s) in binary

Therefore 32768 = 2^15

### Line 4

We first convert 0x2000 to a power of 2:

```plaintext
0x2000 = 0010 0000 0000 0000 = 2^13
```

Now we calculate the decimal value of 2^13:

```plaintext
2^13 = 8192
```

### Line 5

We've just calculated 2^13 in the previous step: 8192, or 0x2000 in hexadecimal.

So, to calculate 2^12, we divide 8192 by 2:

```plaintext
8192 / 2 = 4096
```

And we just remove one 0 from the binary representation of 8192:

```plaintext
8192 = 0010 0000 0000 0000
4096 = 0001 0000 0000 0000 = 0x1000
```

### Line 6

First we calculate the value of 64 in hexadecimal:

```plaintext
64 / 16 = 4 with a remainder of 0
4 / 16 = 0 with a remainder of 4

Therefore 64 in hexadecimal is 0x40
```

To convert 0x40 to a power of 2, we convert it to binary:

```plaintext
0x40 = 0100 0000 = 2^6
```

### Line 7

We first need to find how many 0s 0x100 has in binary:

```plaintext
0x100 = 0001 0000 0000 = 2^8
```

Now we calculate the decimal value of 2^8:

```plaintext
2^8 = 256
```

# Practice Problem 2.5

## Consider the following three calls to show_bytes

```c
int a = 0x12345678;
byte_pointer ap = (byte_pointer) &a;
show_bytes(ap, 1); /* A. */
show_bytes(ap, 2); /* B. */
show_bytes(ap, 3); /* C. */
```

Indicate the values that will be printed by each call on a little-endian machine and a big-endian machine.

## Solution

We can use the [show_bytes.c](../2.1-Information_Storage/show_bytes.c) program to check the answer.

The 2nd argument on each show_bytes defines how many bytes the function will print starting from ap. In a big endian machine the function starts from the MSB to the LSB, while in a little endian machine the function starts from the LSB to the MSB.

So, in a little endian machine the outputs will be be 78, 78 56, and 78 56 34 respectively. In a big endian machine the outputs would be 12, 12 34, and 12 34 56 respectively.

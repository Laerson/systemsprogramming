# Practice Problem 2.12

Write C expressions, in terms of variable x, for the following values. Your code should work for any word size $w \geq 8$. For reference, we show the result of evaluating the expressions for $x = 0x87654321$. with $w = 32$.

## A

The least significant byte of x, with all other bits set to 0. Result: 0x00000021

## B

All but the least significant byte of x complemented, with the least significant byte unchanged. Result: 0x789ABC21

## C

The least significant byte set to all 1s, and all other bytes of x left unchanged. Result: 0x876543FF

## Solution

A

The mask should nullify all bits except the LSB, which should remain unchanged.

We want an operation `op` with two properties:

- A op B = A, for any A, and a specific B.
- A op C = 0, for any A, and a specific C.

The ways we can achieve the first property are:

- A & 1 = A
- A | 0 = A
- A ^ 0 = A

The ways we can achieve the second property are:

- A & 0 = 0

Therefore `op` must be `&`, B  = 1, and C = 0.

so the expression is:

```c
x & 0xFF
```

B

We want to find an operation `op` with two properties:

- A op B = ~A, for any A, and a specific B.
- A op C = A, for any A, and a specific C.

The ways we can achieve the first property are:

- A ^ 1 = ~A

The way we can achieve the second property using `^` is:

- A ^ 0 = A

so the expression is:

```c
x ^ (~0xFF) // Notice that we need to use the complement of 0xFF so the mask works with any word size >= 8.
```

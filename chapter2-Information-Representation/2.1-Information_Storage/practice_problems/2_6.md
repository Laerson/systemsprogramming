# Practice Problem 2.6

## Using *show_int* and *show_float*, we determine that the integer 3510593 has hexadecimal representation 0x00359141, while the floating-point number 3510593.0 has hexadecimal representation 0x4A564504

### A. What is the binary representation of these two hexadecimal values?

### B. Shift these two string relative to one another to maximize the number of matching bits. How many bits match?

### C. What parts of the strings do not match?

## Solution

### A

The binary representation of 0x00359141 is:

```plaintext
0x00359141 = 0000 0000 0011 0101 1001 0001 0100 0001
```

The binary representation of 0x4A564504 is:

```plaintext
0x4A564504 = 0100 1010 0101 0110 0100 0101 0000 0100
```

### B

Putting the two strings side by side, and then shifting them to maximize the number of matching bits:

```plaintext
00000000001'101011001000101000001'
  010010100'101011001000101000001'00
```

21 bits match.

### C

The whole binary representation of the integer(excluding the MSB) matches with the binary representation of the floating-point number (excluding the 9 MSBs and the remaining LSBs).
